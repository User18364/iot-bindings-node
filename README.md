## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly connect DOM elements with physical components.
- **Reusable Components**: Build your own custom bindings and share them across projects.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal footprint to ensure fast loading times.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works with various IoT systems and Node.js applications.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/User18364/iot-bindings-node.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd iot-bindings-node
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

After installing, you can start using the bindings in your HTML files. Here‚Äôs a basic example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>IoT Bindings Example</title>
    <script src="path/to/iot-bindings-node.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="sensor"></div>
    <script>
        const sensor = document.getElementById('sensor');
        sensor.bindToPhysicalComponent('sensor-id');
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `bindToPhysicalComponent` method connects the `div` element with a physical sensor identified by `sensor-id`.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the bindings in different scenarios:

### Example 1: Connecting a Light Bulb

```html
<div id="light-bulb"></div>
<script>
    const lightBulb = document.getElementById('light-bulb');
    lightBulb.bindToPhysicalComponent('light-bulb-id');
</script>
```

### Example 2: Monitoring Temperature

```html
<div id="temperature-display"></div>
<script>
    const temperatureDisplay = document.getElementById('temperature-display');
    temperatureDisplay.bindToPhysicalComponent('temperature-sensor-id');
</script>
```
